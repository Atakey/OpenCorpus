## Introduction
Chinese Word Segmentation and Part-of-Speech Tagging corpus from [China National Language Committee](http://www.aihanyu.org/cncorpus/index.aspx).

Downloaded via searching common characters from CNLC's website. I preprocessed them by removing noises, then combined them to `train`, `dev` and `test` sets in a ratio of `8:1:1`.
